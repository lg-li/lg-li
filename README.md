### ðŸ‘‹ Hello
- ðŸ“· I'm focusing on research topics about **computational photography**, **computational imaging**, and **low-level vision**. 
- âœ¨ I love creating visually pleasing things, including, but not limited to photos, graphics, and UI/UX design.
- ðŸ“– I'm also interested in East Asian (Sinosphere) language learning (Japanese and Korean) and some topics of **phonology** and **historical linguistics** like Middle (Ancient) Chinese.

Seeking people with similar interests to build wonderful things together.
